<h2>Hi! I am the first dialog!</h2>
<p>Test param: {{ param1 }}</p>
<p>I'm working on a POC app, and I'm trying get the MdDialog component working. Does any one have a working example of what
  to pass to the MdDialog open method?</p>
<button md-raised-button (click)="dialogRef.close()">Close dialog</button>`
